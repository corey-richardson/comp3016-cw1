# COMP3016

Was:

This module introduces the concepts and programming techniques for high performance real-time graphics using a relevant graphical API. A bottom-up view of graphical programming is taken, excluding the use of game engines and high-level prototyping tools. Students also learn transferrable skills: programming in an un-managed environment, tools programming, programming for physical interfaces and/or sensors.

Now:

Step into virtual worlds you've built yourself. Explore the technologies behind immersive gaming, from VR to AR, by developing interactive experiences using cutting-edge platforms. Learn how to blend presence, interaction, and storytelling for maximum impact.

At the time when we had to make our module selections earlier this year, the modules description stated that it would introduce "high performance real-time graphics using a graphical API", as well as "programming for physical interfaces and/or sensors". This aligned with what I was after - low-level C++ programming and some systems/hardware programming. 

However, from the new module description now listed on the universities website as well as the CW1 brief, it appears as though the module has shifted focus to be more related to game design frameworks, aesthetics and storytelling, and player engagement. With part of the marking rubrix referring to objective "fun factor" and visual presentation, seems to push the modules scope to be more in the domain of creative game design rather than graphics programming and systems=level development. 

As someone on the Software Engineering programme pathway, I enrolled to this module expecting to develop more technical and performace-oriented programming skills, but I am finding that the modules new direction is quite different as to what was originally advertised. I understand that modules evolve over time but this feels as though it is quite a large shift in content, topic and learning outcomes.

If I had known that this was the direction of this module, I would not have chosen it. I am a student on the Software Engineering track of the programme - not the Game Development track - and with the current direction of this module I do question whether this module remains appropriate for students on the Software Engineering pathway, as it appears to have limited relevance to our intended pathway.

I would appreciate clarification on whether there is scope to approach the coursework from a more technical and programming sided perspective.
