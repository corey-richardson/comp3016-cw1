Immersive Game Technologies

> This is an individual assignment to develop a 2D game in C++. <br>
> Implement a 2D game in C++ and upload to your git repository, then share the link in the readme. Your game needs to adhere to OOP concepts and additionally be able to load file content during execution. Do enough documented testing that it can be built and compile, and that it doesnâ€™t crash upon unexpected input. Lastly, add in as many features as you can to make it story rich and/or fun!
